shortDescription: The First United Methodist Church of Oak Ridge was looking to rebuild their website to focus new digital offerings and simplify the site.

The website had to feel enough like the old site, but it needed a facelift. It also needed some work to gear it towards its new service livestream, podcasts and posts.

Pages with short text were merged together based on topic, a search system was added, posts were easily accessible and services that were posted on YouTube were automatically sourced over. Pages were generally organized and updated to use new tools, and new functionality was added to support some specific offerings, such as choir tracks for practice.

I really like how the site turned out, and our clients did too! It has overall been recieved very well by church members, and I still maintain the site for them.
