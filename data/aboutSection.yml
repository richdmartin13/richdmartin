  ### I want to do things differently - and help others, too.

  I always had a self-starter mindset, even when I was a kid. I detested school because of the rules,
  and I did the usual lawn mowing hustle to buy my first computer. I largely taught myself to code, with some 
  help from high school and college classes, and I taught myself most of the guitar I know.
  Since I couldn't nail down what I really wanted to do, I studied International Business because I believed that
  it would help me achieve my goals. Since graduating, I've taken a 3-month solo trip around Europe and returned to the 
  US to build up my freelance work enough to persue a longer-term digital nomad lifestyle.
